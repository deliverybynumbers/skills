**Category:** Strategy and architecture | **Subcategory:** Strategy and planning

**Overall Description:**

Enabling the effective management and use of information assets.

**Guidance Notes:**

Information assets represent information deemed valuable by an organisation and may be held in many forms including, but not limited to: digital documents, printed material, microform, e-mail, chats and websites. Information may be structured or unstructured and may be created by internal or external sources.
Specific laws and regulations may require organisations to maintain records of certain business activities and transactions for a minimum period.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

identifying, classifying, processing information that is used to support decision-making, business processes and digital services
developing innovative ways of managing the information assets of the organisation
governance of how information is used to support decision-making, business processes and digital services
ensuring information can be discovered and delivered in line with organisational policies and practices
developing and promoting strategies and policies for the design of information architectures, structures and taxonomies
implementing systems of cataloguing, metadata, indexing and classification standards and methods used to organise information

**Level 4 Attainment:**

Enables the organisation to organise, control and discover information assets.
Supports the organisation to identify, catalogue and categorise information types and information repositories in line with information management strategies and practices.
Enables users to find information through appropriate use of metadata and search tools.
Provides advice and guidance to enable good information management practices to be adopted across the organisation.

### Information security (SCTY)

**SFIA Reference:** [SCTY](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/SCTY)

**Category:** Strategy and architecture | **Subcategory:** Security and privacy

**Overall Description:**

Defining and operating a framework of security controls and security management strategies.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

selecting and adapting security frameworks to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems
implementing security controls, including physical, procedural, technical, and compliance measures
ensuring accountability and adherence to relevant laws and standards
embedding secure by design principles throughout the system's lifecycle, ensuring security is integrated from the earliest design stages, through development, deployment, and into operations
identifying and mitigating risks in infrastructure and applications.

Security controls include, but are not limited to:

physical controls - protecting tangible assets and physical environments
procedural or administrative controls - policies and guidelines governing organisational security practices
technical or logical controls - hardware and software measures that protect information systems
legal, regulatory or compliance controls - measures ensuring laws, regulations and industry standards.

These activities are typically performed in collaboration with specialists in other areas including, but not limited to: legal, technical infrastructure, audit, architecture and software engineering.

**Level 4 Attainment:**

Provides guidance on the application and operation of elementary physical, procedural and technical security controls. 
Explains the purpose of security controls and performs security risk and business impact analysis for medium complexity information systems. 
Identifies risks that arise from potential technical solution architectures. Designs alternate solutions or countermeasures and ensures they manage identified risks. 
Investigates suspected attacks and supports security incident management.

### Penetration testing (PENT)

**SFIA Reference:** [PENT](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/PENT)

**Category:** Delivery and operation | **Subcategory:** Security services

**Overall Description:**

Testing the effectiveness of security controls by emulating the tools and techniques of likely attackers.

**Guidance Notes:**

Penetration testing may be a stand-alone activity or an aspect of acceptance testing prior to an approval to operate.
Activities include, but are not limited to:

ethical hacking (using the same tools and techniques as an adversary to safely exploit security weaknesses)
demonstrating how an adversary can subvert security goals or achieve specific adversarial objectives
evaluating the effectiveness of current/planned defences or mitigation controls
assuring the security of networks, systems and applications
assessing the strength and effectiveness of cryptographic implementations
identifying insights into the business risks of various vulnerabilities
testing network, infrastructure, web and mobile applications for weaknesses
checking patch levels and configurations
social engineering.

**Level 4 Attainment:**

Selects appropriate testing approaches using in-depth technical analysis of risks and typical vulnerabilities. 
Produces test scripts, materials and test packs and tests new and existing networks, systems or applications. Provides advice on penetration testing to support others.
Records and analyses actions and results and modifies tests if necessary. 
Provides reports on progress, anomalies, risks and issues associated with the overall project.
