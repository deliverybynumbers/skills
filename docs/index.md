# Tech Department Career Framework

## A Quick Orientation

This framework is here to make engineering progression clearer and more consistent across [Company Name]. It's designed to be practical and easy to use, not something that sits on a shelf. The aim is to give engineers and managers a shared understanding of what progression looks like, what's expected at each level, and how people can grow over time.

At its core, this framework is built on the belief that strong technology outcomes come from strong people and healthy team culture.

A few core ideas shape how this framework works:

- **We've anchored the framework in SFIA (Skills Framework for the Information Age).** SFIA is a widely used industry framework that gives us a common language for engineering capability and progression. Using it helps create clarity and consistency, especially across different teams and businesses, while avoiding reinventing the wheel.

- **Rather than inventing our own definitions from scratch, SFIA gives us a solid, proven foundation.** We then layer our own context and expectations on top, so the framework stays relevant, usable and grounded in real engineering work.

- **The focus is on helping people understand how engineering roles evolve over time, not on creating rigid rules or tick-box assessments.** This framework is designed to support great career progression conversations and building a high performing team culture.

- **Progression in this framework is driven by increasing responsibility, autonomy, influence and complexity, rather than tenure or job title alone.** As you progress as an engineer, so does your autonomy (level of supervision), influence (who and what your work affects), the complexity (ambiguity and scale of problems you're trusted to solve) of your role, and the business skills (context, judgement and organisational awareness) needed to operate successfully.

- **This framework isn't about covering every possible task an engineer might take on.** It's about making the meaningful differences between levels clear, especially as responsibility, autonomy and scope increase over time.

- **Engineers are not expected to demonstrate equal depth across every skill.** The framework recognises that different roles and strengths show up in different ways.

This framework exists to support you doing the work you do, recognising that clarity, trust and good conversations are essential to sustainable engineering individual and team performance.

## How We Work Matters

While the framework describes skills, levels and responsibility, progression is not just about what you do. It's also about how you work with others, how you approach problems, and how you contribute to a healthy, high-performing team.

Across all roles and levels, we expect engineers to demonstrate five core behaviours. These behaviours are referenced throughout the framework and form part of how performance and progression conversations are approached in practice:

### Collaboration

Working effectively with others to achieve shared outcomes. This means communicating openly, involving the right people at the right time, and contributing to team success rather than operating in silos. It includes giving and receiving input constructively and recognising that better outcomes come from working together, not working alone.

### Problem Solving

Taking ownership of issues and working through them in a structured, practical way. This means identifying the real problem (not just the symptom), exploring options, and making sensible decisions based on evidence and impact. It also includes knowing when to ask for help and escalating appropriately when something is beyond your remit.

### Improvement Mindset

A consistent focus on making things better over time. This means being curious about how work could be done more effectively, learning from mistakes, and applying feedback to improve quality, performance, or ways of working. It's about progress, not perfection, and being open to change when something isn't working.

### Communication

Sharing information clearly, honestly, and in a way that others can understand. This means explaining technical topics in plain language where needed, keeping people informed, raising concerns early, and listening as well as speaking. Good communication reduces risk, avoids misunderstanding, and builds trust across the team and wider business.

### Security and Ethics

Acting responsibly and professionally when handling systems, data, and decisions. This means following security practices, protecting sensitive information, and considering the wider impact of actions on customers, colleagues, and the business. It also includes speaking up when something feels unsafe, unethical, or risky, rather than ignoring it.

## How Progression Shows Up in Practice

Progression in this framework is defined by increasing responsibility and scope. Impact is the visible result of the responsibility you're taking on.

As you progress, the problems you take ownership of become more complex, your influence widens, and the outcomes you're accountable for matter more to the team and the business. What that looks like will vary by role and discipline, but progression always involves taking responsibility for outcomes at the right level.

Looking at impact helps avoid turning this framework into a checklist. Rather than focusing on whether specific tasks have been completed, we look at how you operate day to day and the difference that creates for the business.

In practice, evidence of progression often shows up through things like:

- Choosing work that meaningfully moves the team, product or business forward, in line with the scope of your role.
- Identifying opportunities to improve engineering outcomes and making those opportunities visible so they can be discussed and prioritised.
- Consistently delivering, contributing to shared goals and earning trust as a reliable, high-quality engineer.
- Applying the right level of complexity, keeping things simple where possible.
- Building systems and services that are resilient, well tested and able to scale as the business grows.

Used this way, the framework supports conversations, helping you and your manager ground the level and skill expectations in clear, observable examples.

## Technical Skills

This section is about how you apply your technical ability and develop your craft. It describes the behaviours that show effective technical contribution at different levels of complexity and ambiguity.

We look at technical contribution through four lenses: quality, testability, performance and your ability to design and review systems.

Excellence here looks like:

- Your code and technical work are considered high quality by your peers and senior engineers.
- You can design systems that solve business problems efficiently and reduce ambiguity at both the technical and product level.
- You design with the right level of complexity, keeping things simple where possible.
- Your work is resilient, well tested and capable of scaling as the business grows.

## Behaviours

Behaviours sit alongside technical skills and impact. They cover the core habits, mindsets and ways of working we expect engineers at [Company Name] to show.

Through your behaviour you set the tone for those around you. Great engineers role model great behaviours, and self-aware engineers know when they are setting a strong example.

Behaviours reflect consistent habits and intentional choices, rather than doing the right thing by chance or on "autopilot".
