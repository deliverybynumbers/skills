**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Architecting and designing software to meet specified requirements, ensuring adherence to established standards and principles.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

designing and architecting software applications, components, interfaces and related characteristics (including security)
designing for scalability, performance, resilience, security and privacy from the outset, aligned with cloud computing, distributed systems and data protection
applying design concepts, patterns, modelling techniques and architectural styles such as microservices, serverless and domain-driven design to develop software designs and architectures, which serve as the foundation for software construction and verification
evaluating alternative solutions and trade-offs to facilitate design decisions
considering functional and non-functional requirements such as the target environment, performance, security, scalability and integration with existing systems
adopting and adapting software design models, tools and techniques based on the context of the work, including contemporary practices such as cloud-native architectures, edge computing, cyber-physical systems and agile and iterative design practices
developing prototypes/simulations to enable informed decision-making.

Unlike programming and designing at the code level, this skill focuses on higher-level design, addressing architecture and system-wide considerations.

**Level 5 Attainment:**

Specifies, designs and architects large or complex software applications, components and modules. 
Adopts and adapts software design methods, tools and techniques. Undertakes impact analysis on major design options, makes recommendations and assesses and manages associated risks. Specifies prototypes/simulations to enable informed decision-making. 
Evaluates software designs to ensure adherence to standards and identifies corrective action. Ensures the software design balances functional, quality, security and systems management requirements. 
Contributes to the development of organisational software design and architecture policies and standards.

**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Developing software components to deliver value to stakeholders.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

identifying, creating and applying software development and security standards and processes
planning and designing software components
estimating time and effort required for software development
constructing, amending, and verifying software components, ensuring security is embedded
applying test-driven development and ensuring appropriate test coverage
using peer review techniques such as pair programming
documenting software components
understanding and obtaining agreement to the value of the software components to be developed
selecting appropriate development methods and lifecycles
applying recovery techniques to ensure the software being developed is not lost 
implementing appropriate change control to software development practices
resolving operational problems with software and fixing bugs

Depending on requirements and the characteristics of the project or assigned work, software development methods and lifecycles can be predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.

**Level 5 Attainment:**

Takes technical responsibility across all stages and iterations of software development. 
Plans and drives software construction activities. Adopts and adapts appropriate software development methods, tools and techniques. 
Measures and monitors applications of project/team standards for software construction, including software security. 
Contributes to the development of organisational policies, standards and guidelines for software development.

### Solution architecture (ARCH)

**SFIA Reference:** [ARCH](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/ARCH)

**Category:** Strategy and architecture | **Subcategory:** Strategy and planning

**Overall Description:**

Developing and communicating a multi-dimensional solution architecture to deliver agreed business outcomes.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

defining the planned operation and maintenance of the solution within a production environment, including changes to services, processes, organisation and operating models as well as technology 
ensuring existing and planned solution components are compatible with relevant architectures, strategies, policies, standards and practices 
considering requirements for security, privacy and testing of solutions
taking account of relevant architectures, strategies, policies, standards and practices 
identifying appropriate cloud services, evaluating their cost implications and optimising for cost-efficiency
developing roadmaps to migrate components to cloud services
developing and communicating an implementation roadmap 
providing guidance and risk-based governance to support solution implementation including managing requests for changes and deviations from specifications.

**Level 5 Attainment:**

Leads the development of solution architectures in specific business, infrastructure or functional areas. 
Leads the preparation of technical plans and ensures appropriate technical resources are made available. Ensures appropriate tools and methods are available, understood and employed in architecture development.
Provides technical guidance and governance on solution development and integration. Evaluates requests for changes and deviations from specifications and recommends actions.
Ensures relevant technical strategies, policies, standards and practices (including security and cost management) are applied correctly.
