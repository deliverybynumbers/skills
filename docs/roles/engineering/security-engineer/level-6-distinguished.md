# Distinguished Security Engineer

**Level 6** | **Career Path:** Engineering

**Engineer Type:** Security

---

## Framework Overview

Our approach is built around a small number of core ideas that shape engineering progression:

- **Impact-focused**: We focus on the impact each engineer has on moving the business forward, rather than on long lists of specific skills and behaviours.
- **Scope increases with seniority**: As you grow, so does the complexity and size of the problems you are expected to solve. As the business grows, the engineering challenges should grow with it.
- **Simple and meaningful**: This framework brings the most important behaviours and expectations together in a simple way. It is not meant to cover everything an engineer might do, but to highlight the meaningful differences between levels.
- **Broad behaviours**: Behaviours are intentionally broad so they reflect the many ways engineers can contribute. Our aim is to describe the level of technical contribution and mindset we expect at each stage, not create a checklist of tasks.
- **Supporting conversations**: We want to make space for the different ways people add value. This framework exists to support 1:1s, performance reviews and development conversations, helping managers and engineers talk clearly about scope, impact and alignment with our engineering principles.
- **Practice-focused**: The framework focuses on the practice of engineering itself, not the specific tools or languages you use.

**Levels are cumulative**: Each level builds on the one before it. Engineers are expected to show the behaviours and technical habits of earlier levels as they progress.

### Impact

Impact is the primary driver for progression. Your impact reflects your sphere of influence and the contribution you make to our mission and goals. Different roles and disciplines create impact in different ways. Focusing on impact allows us to recognise engineers who move things forward (and who "get things done") without requiring them to perform specific routines.

Impact grows through a mix of building technical skill, gaining real experience, learning from that experience and pairing it with the right behaviours.

**Excellence here looks like:**

- Choosing work that meaningfully moves your team, discipline and the business forward, in line with the scope of your role.
- Identifying opportunities to improve engineering outcomes and making them clear so the team can prioritise effectively.
- Consistently getting things done, contributing to the team and earning a reputation as a reliable, high-quality engineer.

### Technical Skills

This section is about how you apply your technical ability and develop your craft. It describes the behaviours that show effective technical contribution at different levels of complexity and ambiguity.

We look at technical contribution through four lenses: quality, testability, performance and your ability to design and review systems.

**Excellence here looks like:**

- Your code and technical work are considered high quality by your peers and senior engineers.
- You can design systems that solve business problems efficiently and reduce ambiguity at both the technical and product level.
- You design with the right level of complexity, keeping things simple where possible.
- Your work is resilient, well tested and capable of scaling as the business grows.

### Behaviours

Behaviours sit alongside technical skills and impact. They cover the core habits, mindsets and ways of working we expect engineers to show.

Through your behaviour you set the tone for those around you. Great engineers role model great behaviours, and self-aware engineers know when they are setting a strong example.

Behaviours reflect consistent habits and intentional choices, rather than doing the right thing by chance or on "autopilot".

## Role Overview

**Scope Summary:** An exceptional technical leader recognised for outstanding contributions to engineering excellence.

Distinguished Engineers are exceptional technical leaders recognised for their outstanding contributions to engineering excellence and organisational impact.

## Required SFIA Skills

The following SFIA skills define the expected skills and behaviors for this role at this level:

### Information management (IRMG)

**SFIA Reference:** [IRMG](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/IRMG)

**Category:** Strategy and architecture | **Subcategory:** Strategy and planning

**Overall Description:**

Enabling the effective management and use of information assets.

**Guidance Notes:**

Information assets represent information deemed valuable by an organisation and may be held in many forms including, but not limited to: digital documents, printed material, microform, e-mail, chats and websites. Information may be structured or unstructured and may be created by internal or external sources.
Specific laws and regulations may require organisations to maintain records of certain business activities and transactions for a minimum period.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

identifying, classifying, processing information that is used to support decision-making, business processes and digital services
developing innovative ways of managing the information assets of the organisation
governance of how information is used to support decision-making, business processes and digital services
ensuring information can be discovered and delivered in line with organisational policies and practices
developing and promoting strategies and policies for the design of information architectures, structures and taxonomies
implementing systems of cataloguing, metadata, indexing and classification standards and methods used to organise information

**Level 6 Attainment:**

Leads and plans activities to communicate and implement information management strategies and policies.  
Develops organisational policies, standards and guidelines for information management. 
Ensures the information required to support the organisation is defined. Creates information management processes.  
Coordinates internal and externally sourced information resources to meet specific business objectives.

### Information security (SCTY)

**SFIA Reference:** [SCTY](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/SCTY)

**Category:** Strategy and architecture | **Subcategory:** Security and privacy

**Overall Description:**

Defining and operating a framework of security controls and security management strategies.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

selecting and adapting security frameworks to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems
implementing security controls, including physical, procedural, technical, and compliance measures
ensuring accountability and adherence to relevant laws and standards
embedding secure by design principles throughout the system's lifecycle, ensuring security is integrated from the earliest design stages, through development, deployment, and into operations
identifying and mitigating risks in infrastructure and applications.

Security controls include, but are not limited to:

physical controls - protecting tangible assets and physical environments
procedural or administrative controls - policies and guidelines governing organisational security practices
technical or logical controls - hardware and software measures that protect information systems
legal, regulatory or compliance controls - measures ensuring laws, regulations and industry standards.

These activities are typically performed in collaboration with specialists in other areas including, but not limited to: legal, technical infrastructure, audit, architecture and software engineering.

**Level 6 Attainment:**

Develops and communicates corporate information security policy, standards and guidelines.  
Ensures architectural principles are applied during design to reduce risk. Drives adoption and adherence to policy, standards and guidelines. 
Contributes to the development of organisational strategies that address information control requirements. Identifies and monitors environmental and market trends and proactively assesses impact on business strategies, benefits and risks. 
Leads the provision of authoritative advice and guidance on the requirements for security controls in collaboration with subject matter experts.

### Penetration testing (PENT)

**SFIA Reference:** [PENT](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/PENT)

**Category:** Delivery and operation | **Subcategory:** Security services

**Overall Description:**

Testing the effectiveness of security controls by emulating the tools and techniques of likely attackers.

**Guidance Notes:**

Penetration testing may be a stand-alone activity or an aspect of acceptance testing prior to an approval to operate.
