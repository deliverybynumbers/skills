## Framework Overview

Our approach is built around a small number of core ideas that shape engineering progression:

- **Impact-focused**: We focus on the impact each engineer has on moving the business forward, rather than on long lists of specific skills and behaviours.
- **Scope increases with seniority**: As you grow, so does the complexity and size of the problems you are expected to solve. As the business grows, the engineering challenges should grow with it.
- **Simple and meaningful**: This framework brings the most important behaviours and expectations together in a simple way. It is not meant to cover everything an engineer might do, but to highlight the meaningful differences between levels.
- **Broad behaviours**: Behaviours are intentionally broad so they reflect the many ways engineers can contribute. Our aim is to describe the level of technical contribution and mindset we expect at each stage, not create a checklist of tasks.
- **Supporting conversations**: We want to make space for the different ways people add value. This framework exists to support 1:1s, performance reviews and development conversations, helping managers and engineers talk clearly about scope, impact and alignment with our engineering principles.
- **Practice-focused**: The framework focuses on the practice of engineering itself, not the specific tools or languages you use.

**Levels are cumulative**: Each level builds on the one before it. Engineers are expected to show the behaviours and technical habits of earlier levels as they progress.

### Impact

Impact is the primary driver for progression. Your impact reflects your sphere of influence and the contribution you make to our mission and goals. Different roles and disciplines create impact in different ways. Focusing on impact allows us to recognise engineers who move things forward (and who "get things done") without requiring them to perform specific routines.

Impact grows through a mix of building technical skill, gaining real experience, learning from that experience and pairing it with the right behaviours.

**Excellence here looks like:**

- Choosing work that meaningfully moves your team, discipline and the business forward, in line with the scope of your role.
- Identifying opportunities to improve engineering outcomes and making them clear so the team can prioritise effectively.
- Consistently getting things done, contributing to the team and earning a reputation as a reliable, high-quality engineer.

### Technical Skills

This section is about how you apply your technical ability and develop your craft. It describes the behaviours that show effective technical contribution at different levels of complexity and ambiguity.

We look at technical contribution through four lenses: quality, testability, performance and your ability to design and review systems.

**Excellence here looks like:**

- Your code and technical work are considered high quality by your peers and senior engineers.
- You can design systems that solve business problems efficiently and reduce ambiguity at both the technical and product level.
- You design with the right level of complexity, keeping things simple where possible.
- Your work is resilient, well tested and capable of scaling as the business grows.

### Behaviours

Behaviours sit alongside technical skills and impact. They cover the core habits, mindsets and ways of working we expect engineers to show.

Through your behaviour you set the tone for those around you. Great engineers role model great behaviours, and self-aware engineers know when they are setting a strong example.

Behaviours reflect consistent habits and intentional choices, rather than doing the right thing by chance or on "autopilot".

## Role Overview

**Scope Summary:** An exceptional technical leader recognised for outstanding contributions to engineering excellence.

Distinguished Engineers are exceptional technical leaders recognised for their outstanding contributions to engineering excellence and organisational impact.

## Required SFIA Skills

The following SFIA skills define the expected skills and behaviors for this role at this level:

### Portfolio management (POMG)

**SFIA Reference:** [POMG](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/POMG)

**Category:** Change and transformation | **Subcategory:** Change implementation

**Overall Description:**

Developing and applying a management framework to define and deliver a portfolio of programmes, projects and/or ongoing services.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities include, but are not limited to:

alignment of investment with specific business strategies and objectives
ensuring governance frameworks guide strategic investment appraisal and decision-making processes
assessment of cost, risk, inter-dependencies and impact on existing business activities
identifying issues with portfolio structure, cost, risk, inter-dependencies, impact on current business activities and the strategic benefits to be realised
implementing portfolio management practices that support iterative/agile working
measurement and objective evaluation of potential changes and the benefits to be realised
prioritisation of resource utilisation and changes to be implemented
regular review of portfolios
management of the service pipeline (proposed or in development), service catalogue (live or available for deployment) and retired services.

**Level 6 Attainment:**

Engages and influences senior managers to ensure the portfolio will deliver the agreed business objectives. 
Leads the definition, planning, scheduling and monitoring of portfolio activities, ensuring alignment with governance standards. 
Ensures each portfolio component contributes to the overall objectives. Identifies and addresses portfolio-related issues, recommending and monitoring corrective actions. 
Collects and summarises portfolio measures, reporting on status and ensuring compliance with governance frameworks.
