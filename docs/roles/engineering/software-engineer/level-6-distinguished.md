**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

designing and architecting software applications, components, interfaces and related characteristics (including security)
designing for scalability, performance, resilience, security and privacy from the outset, aligned with cloud computing, distributed systems and data protection
applying design concepts, patterns, modelling techniques and architectural styles such as microservices, serverless and domain-driven design to develop software designs and architectures, which serve as the foundation for software construction and verification
evaluating alternative solutions and trade-offs to facilitate design decisions
considering functional and non-functional requirements such as the target environment, performance, security, scalability and integration with existing systems
adopting and adapting software design models, tools and techniques based on the context of the work, including contemporary practices such as cloud-native architectures, edge computing, cyber-physical systems and agile and iterative design practices
developing prototypes/simulations to enable informed decision-making.
