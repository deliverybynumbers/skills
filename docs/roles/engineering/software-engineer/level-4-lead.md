## Required SFIA Skills

The following SFIA skills define the expected skills and behaviors for this role at this level:

### Software design (SWDN)

**SFIA Reference:** [SWDN](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/SWDN)

**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Architecting and designing software to meet specified requirements, ensuring adherence to established standards and principles.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

designing and architecting software applications, components, interfaces and related characteristics (including security)
designing for scalability, performance, resilience, security and privacy from the outset, aligned with cloud computing, distributed systems and data protection
applying design concepts, patterns, modelling techniques and architectural styles such as microservices, serverless and domain-driven design to develop software designs and architectures, which serve as the foundation for software construction and verification
evaluating alternative solutions and trade-offs to facilitate design decisions
considering functional and non-functional requirements such as the target environment, performance, security, scalability and integration with existing systems
adopting and adapting software design models, tools and techniques based on the context of the work, including contemporary practices such as cloud-native architectures, edge computing, cyber-physical systems and agile and iterative design practices
developing prototypes/simulations to enable informed decision-making.

Unlike programming and designing at the code level, this skill focuses on higher-level design, addressing architecture and system-wide considerations.

**Level 4 Attainment:**

Designs and architects complex software applications, components and modules.
Uses appropriate modelling techniques in line with agreed software design standards, guidelines, patterns and methodologies. Produces and communicates multiple design views to address stakeholder concerns and meet both functional and non-functional requirements including security.
Identifies, evaluates and recommends design alternatives and trade-offs. Models, simulates or prototypes proposed software behaviours to secure stakeholder approval and facilitate effective software construction.  
Reviews, verifies and enhances own designs against specifications and leads reviews of others' designs.

applying test-driven development and ensuring appropriate test coverage
using peer review techniques such as pair programming
documenting software components
understanding and obtaining agreement to the value of the software components to be developed
selecting appropriate development methods and lifecycles
applying recovery techniques to ensure the software being developed is not lost 
implementing appropriate change control to software development practices
resolving operational problems with software and fixing bugs

Depending on requirements and the characteristics of the project or assigned work, software development methods and lifecycles can be predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.

**Level 4 Attainment:**

Designs, codes, verifies, tests, documents, amends and refactors complex programs/scripts and integration software services. 
Contributes to the selection of the software development methods, tools, techniques, and security practices.
Applies agreed standards, tools, and security measures to achieve well-engineered outcomes.
Participates in reviews of own work and leads reviews of colleagues' work.

### Solution architecture (ARCH)

**SFIA Reference:** [ARCH](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/ARCH)

**Category:** Strategy and architecture | **Subcategory:** Strategy and planning

**Overall Description:**

Developing and communicating a multi-dimensional solution architecture to deliver agreed business outcomes.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

defining the planned operation and maintenance of the solution within a production environment, including changes to services, processes, organisation and operating models as well as technology 
ensuring existing and planned solution components are compatible with relevant architectures, strategies, policies, standards and practices 
considering requirements for security, privacy and testing of solutions
taking account of relevant architectures, strategies, policies, standards and practices 
identifying appropriate cloud services, evaluating their cost implications and optimising for cost-efficiency
developing roadmaps to migrate components to cloud services
developing and communicating an implementation roadmap 
providing guidance and risk-based governance to support solution implementation including managing requests for changes and deviations from specifications.

**Level 4 Attainment:**

Contributes to the development of solution architectures in specific business, infrastructure or functional areas. 
Identifies and evaluates alternative architectures and the trade-offs in cost, performance and scalability. Determines and documents architecturally significant decisions. 
Produces specifications of cloud-based or on-premises components, tiers and interfaces, for translation into detailed designs using selected services and products. 
Supports projects or change initiatives through the preparation of technical plans and application of design principles. Aligns solutions with enterprise and solution architecture standards (including security).
