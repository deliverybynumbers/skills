**Category:** Delivery and operation | **Subcategory:** Technology management

**Overall Description:**

Provisioning, deploying, configuring, operating and optimising technology infrastructure across physical, virtual and cloud-based environments.

**Guidance Notes:**

Technology infrastructure encompasses a wide range of components including, but not limited to, physical devices, virtual resources, cloud services, infrastructure-related software, middleware, network services and data storage solutions.
Infrastructure operations also involves implementing automation, cybersecurity measures and the adoption of cloud technologies to enhance efficiency, security and agility.
These components may be on-premises, outsourced to third parties, or provisioned through cloud services.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

provisioning and adapting infrastructure components to meet the evolving needs of users and service providers
managing virtual, cloud and hybrid/multi-cloud environments
automating tasks through scripting, coding, orchestration tools and infrastructure as code (IaC) practices
ensuring infrastructure security through regular updates, patch management and adherence to cybersecurity policies and established industry practices
monitoring infrastructure performance and its impact on efficiency, performance, security posture and sustainability
collaborating with development teams (DevOps) 
using containerisation technologies to enhance application deployment and scalability.

**Level 1 Attainment:**

Supports routine infrastructure tasks and basic troubleshooting under close supervision.
Monitors infrastructure health and reports on component status to support operational continuity.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

designing and implementing different processes and procedures for different categories of incidents including, but not limited to, major incidents, information or cybersecurity incidents, complex incidents and low impact incidents
establishing incident response teams or security incident response teams
enhancing preparedness through regular testing, training, simulations and development of incident response plans and playbooks
restoring service to users as quickly as possible, prioritising service continuity over permanent solutions
managing unplanned interruptions to a service or reductions in service quality
routing requests for help to appropriate functions for resolution
monitoring resolution activity
ensuring compliance with regulations and data privacy requirements 
using automation and data-driven tools for earlier and faster incident detection and resolution
informing users, customers and key stakeholders of progress towards service restoration.

Incidents can impact areas such as business operations, information and cyber security, IT systems, services, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.
Different roles or groups may be needed to diagnose and resolve incidents. These can include users, subject matter experts, service desk staff, support teams, suppliers, and partners. Although they participate in the incident management process, they do not necessarily require incident management skills.

**Level 1 Attainment:**
