developing innovative ways of managing the information assets of the organisation
governance of how information is used to support decision-making, business processes and digital services
ensuring information can be discovered and delivered in line with organisational policies and practices
developing and promoting strategies and policies for the design of information architectures, structures and taxonomies
implementing systems of cataloguing, metadata, indexing and classification standards and methods used to organise information

**Level 5 Attainment:**

Ensures implementation of information and records management policies and standard practice.  Communicates the benefits and value of information management. 
Plans effective information storage, sharing and publishing within the organisation. Develops organisational taxonomy for information assets. 
Provides expert advice and guidance to enable the organisation to get maximum value from its information assets.

### Information security (SCTY)

**SFIA Reference:** [SCTY](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/SCTY)

**Category:** Strategy and architecture | **Subcategory:** Security and privacy

**Overall Description:**

Defining and operating a framework of security controls and security management strategies.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

selecting and adapting security frameworks to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems
implementing security controls, including physical, procedural, technical, and compliance measures
ensuring accountability and adherence to relevant laws and standards
embedding secure by design principles throughout the system's lifecycle, ensuring security is integrated from the earliest design stages, through development, deployment, and into operations
identifying and mitigating risks in infrastructure and applications.

Security controls include, but are not limited to:

physical controls - protecting tangible assets and physical environments
procedural or administrative controls - policies and guidelines governing organisational security practices
technical or logical controls - hardware and software measures that protect information systems
legal, regulatory or compliance controls - measures ensuring laws, regulations and industry standards.

These activities are typically performed in collaboration with specialists in other areas including, but not limited to: legal, technical infrastructure, audit, architecture and software engineering.

**Level 5 Attainment:**

Provides advice and guidance on security strategies to manage identified risks and ensure adoption and adherence to standards. 
Contributes to development of information security policy, standards and guidelines. 
Obtains and acts on vulnerability information and conducts security risk assessments, business impact analysis and accreditation on complex information systems. Investigates major breaches of security and recommends appropriate control improvements.

### Penetration testing (PENT)

**SFIA Reference:** [PENT](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/PENT)

**Category:** Delivery and operation | **Subcategory:** Security services

**Overall Description:**

Testing the effectiveness of security controls by emulating the tools and techniques of likely attackers.

**Guidance Notes:**

Penetration testing may be a stand-alone activity or an aspect of acceptance testing prior to an approval to operate.
Activities include, but are not limited to:

ethical hacking (using the same tools and techniques as an adversary to safely exploit security weaknesses)
demonstrating how an adversary can subvert security goals or achieve specific adversarial objectives
evaluating the effectiveness of current/planned defences or mitigation controls
assuring the security of networks, systems and applications
assessing the strength and effectiveness of cryptographic implementations
identifying insights into the business risks of various vulnerabilities
testing network, infrastructure, web and mobile applications for weaknesses
checking patch levels and configurations
social engineering.

**Level 5 Attainment:**

Plans and drives penetration testing within a defined area of business activity. 
Delivers objective insights into the existence of vulnerabilities, the effectiveness of defences and mitigating controls. 
Takes responsibility for the integrity of testing activities and coordinates the execution of these activities. Provides authoritative advice and guidance on all aspects of penetration testing. 
Identifies needs and implements new approaches for penetration testing. Contributes to security testing standards.
