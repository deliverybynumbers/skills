# Security Engineer

**Level 2** | **Career Path:** Engineering

**Engineer Type:** Security

---

## Role Overview

**Scope Summary:** An engineer with high potential, developing the fundamentals they need to be successful in their team.

Engineers are in the earlier stages of their software engineering career. They're working on well-defined tasks and are supported by the team when stuck. They're expected to ask lots of questions. As someone progresses toward "Senior Engineer" they should start to gain confidence to pick up larger or less well-defined tasks with less required support.

## Required SFIA Skills

The following SFIA skills define the expected skills and behaviors for this role at this level:

### Information security (SCTY)

**SFIA Reference:** [SCTY](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/SCTY)

**Category:** Strategy and architecture | **Subcategory:** Security and privacy

**Overall Description:**

Defining and operating a framework of security controls and security management strategies.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

selecting and adapting security frameworks to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems
implementing security controls, including physical, procedural, technical, and compliance measures
ensuring accountability and adherence to relevant laws and standards
embedding secure by design principles throughout the system's lifecycle, ensuring security is integrated from the earliest design stages, through development, deployment, and into operations
identifying and mitigating risks in infrastructure and applications.

Security controls include, but are not limited to:

physical controls - protecting tangible assets and physical environments
procedural or administrative controls - policies and guidelines governing organisational security practices
technical or logical controls - hardware and software measures that protect information systems
legal, regulatory or compliance controls - measures ensuring laws, regulations and industry standards.

These activities are typically performed in collaboration with specialists in other areas including, but not limited to: legal, technical infrastructure, audit, architecture and software engineering.

**Level 2 Attainment:**

Assists with implementing and monitoring security policies and protocols across different systems.
Contributes to identifying and addressing potential risks in security governance and compliance.
Supports the analysis of documented security incidents, escalating where appropriate.
Assists in the review of access controls and permissions, ensuring adherence to security policies.

### Penetration testing (PENT)

**SFIA Reference:** [PENT](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/PENT)

**Category:** Delivery and operation | **Subcategory:** Security services

**Overall Description:**

Testing the effectiveness of security controls by emulating the tools and techniques of likely attackers.

**Guidance Notes:**

Penetration testing may be a stand-alone activity or an aspect of acceptance testing prior to an approval to operate.
Activities include, but are not limited to:

ethical hacking (using the same tools and techniques as an adversary to safely exploit security weaknesses)
demonstrating how an adversary can subvert security goals or achieve specific adversarial objectives
evaluating the effectiveness of current/planned defences or mitigation controls
assuring the security of networks, systems and applications
assessing the strength and effectiveness of cryptographic implementations
identifying insights into the business risks of various vulnerabilities
testing network, infrastructure, web and mobile applications for weaknesses
checking patch levels and configurations
social engineering.

**Level 2 Attainment:**

Assists with penetration testing tasks under routine supervision.
Supports the execution of standard penetration tests on systems, networks and applications.
Helps document and report on test results, findings and potential security risks.
