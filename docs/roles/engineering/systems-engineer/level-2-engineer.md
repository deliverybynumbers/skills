# Systems Engineer

**Level 2** | **Career Path:** Engineering

**Engineer Type:** Systems

---

## Role Overview

**Scope Summary:** An engineer with high potential, developing the fundamentals they need to be successful in their team.

Engineers are in the earlier stages of their software engineering career. They're working on well-defined tasks and are supported by the team when stuck. They're expected to ask lots of questions. As someone progresses toward "Senior Engineer" they should start to gain confidence to pick up larger or less well-defined tasks with less required support.
