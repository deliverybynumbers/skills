## Required SFIA Skills

The following SFIA skills define the expected skills and behaviors for this role at this level:

### Functional testing (TEST)

**SFIA Reference:** [TEST](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/TEST)

**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Assessing specified or unspecified functional requirements and characteristics of products, systems and services through investigation and testing.

**Guidance Notes:**

Functional testing verifies that systems, components and interfaces deliver specific functionality, operate as intended and meet user expectations. Risk-based test planning and execution is a key aspect, focusing on identifying and mitigating risks such as functionality errors, integration failures, edge case defects, data inconsistencies and non-compliance with requirements.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

collaborating with stakeholders to align testing with business requirements and objectives
designing and adapting test cases based on requirements, including various scenarios, boundary values and edge cases
preparing data and configuring environments to simulate realistic use cases
executing tests to verify actual results align with expected outcomes
logging defects with detailed reproduction steps, prioritising issues and providing feedback for improvements
analysing results to identify patterns, assess quality and suggest system/testing enhancements
promoting a shift-left approach by integrating functional testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection
managing, executing and automating tests, including regression and smoke tests, to improve efficiency and coverage
developing and maintaining scalable, reliable automated tests and frameworks to validate critical functionality and ensure continuous quality
ensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.

**Level 6 Attainment:**

Develops organisational policies, standards and guidelines for functional testing, ensuring they align with business strategy and incorporate a risk-based approach.
Plans and leads complex testing initiatives, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives and incorporating a risk-based approach.
Manages risks and opportunities, coordinates with other testing activities and drives improvements in functional testing capabilities.
Promotes a culture of quality in functional testing, driving adherence to organisational standards and proactive risk mitigation.

### Non-functional testing (NFTS)

**SFIA Reference:** [NFTS](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/NFTS)

**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Assessing systems and services to evaluate performance, security, scalability and other non-functional qualities against requirements or expected standards.

**Guidance Notes:**

Non-functional testing assesses the behaviour of technology, system components, configurations and packages, ensuring they work together to support the system's operation. It focuses on identifying and mitigating risks related to system qualities and characteristics, such as performance, security, backup and recovery, availability, scalability, reliability, maintainability, monitoring, resource efficiency and compliance with technical standards.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

collaborating with stakeholders to clarify non-functional requirements and expectations
setting up test environments that mirror production conditions, simulating real-world usage
preparing and managing test data to accurately represent necessary variety and volumes
designing and executing stress, load, security and other non-functional tests
troubleshooting issues during testing, coordinating with technical teams to resolve problems
participating in reviews to refine non-functional requirements, identifying risks and suggesting enhancements
analysing results to assess system performance, security and other key qualities, providing insights for improvement
promoting a shift-left approach by integrating non-functional testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection
adapting testing strategies to suit various development methodologies
developing and maintaining automated tests, monitoring systems and frameworks to continuously assess system quality and performance
ensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.

**Level 6 Attainment:**

Develops organisational policies, standards and guidelines for non-functional testing, ensuring they align with business strategy and incorporate a risk-based approach.
Plans and leads strategic, complex testing activities, ensuring they align with overall system quality goals. Manages risks and opportunities, coordinating with other types of testing.
Develops organisational capabilities to address complex quality validation challenges. Drives continuous automation and improvements in test environments.
Promotes a culture of quality in non-functional testing, driving adherence to organisational standards and proactive risk mitigation.

### Quality assurance (QUAS)

**SFIA Reference:** [QUAS](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/QUAS)

**Category:** Strategy and architecture | **Subcategory:** Governance, risk and compliance

**Overall Description:**

Assuring, through ongoing and periodic assessments and reviews, that the organisations quality objectives are being met.

**Guidance Notes:**

Quality assurance provides confidence to internal and external stakeholders that quality requirements will be fulfilled.
Quality assurance provides confidence to internal and external stakeholders that quality requirements will be fulfilled. It may relate to any area where quality standards are applied, including products, data, services and business processes.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

planning and conducting quality assessments and quality audits
reviewing processes, products and services against defined quality criteria
identifying and reporting on quality issues and non-conformances
recommending corrective actions and improvements
verifying the implementation and effectiveness of corrective actions
promoting quality awareness throughout the organisation.

**Level 6 Attainment:**

Leads, develops and is accountable for an organisational approach and commitment to quality assurance.
Ensures quality assurance processes and activities are robust and reliable, and appropriately tailored to the organisations quality objectives. Plans and resources the organisational quality assurance activities, using internal or third-party resources.
Considers the implications of emerging technology, approaches, trends, regulations and legislation.
Monitors and reports on quality assurance activities, levels of compliance and improvement opportunities.

### User acceptance testing (BPTS)

**SFIA Reference:** [BPTS](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/BPTS)

**Category:** Change and transformation | **Subcategory:** Change analysis

**Overall Description:**

Validating systems, products, business processes or services to determine whether the acceptance criteria have been satisfied.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities include, but are not limited to:

setting and applying standards for user acceptance testing (UAT)
planning, identifying, designing, managing, executing and reporting on the outcomes of acceptance tests
collaborating with a range of relevant stakeholders
defining clear entry and exit criteria for UAT
requesting and enabling formal acceptance of systems, products or services
creating measurable acceptance criteria related to functional and non-functional requirements, features, business processes, user stories and business rules
devising test cases and scenarios from acceptance criteria
enabling exploratory testing to discover unexpected behaviours
deploying model office testing to simulate real-world usage
ensuring appropriate training for users involved in UAT
providing input on UAT resource requirements, including necessary skills and availability.

The acceptance testing approach will be based on the context of the work and may be selected from predictive (plan-driven) or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.

**Level 6 Attainment:**

Leads the organisation's approach to user acceptance testing.
Engages senior stakeholders to secure organisational commitment and resources for effective acceptance testing.
