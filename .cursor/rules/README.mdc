# Cursor Rules for Career Framework Project

This directory contains project-specific rules and guidelines for working with the Career Framework documentation project. These rules help maintain consistency, prevent common mistakes, and guide development practices.

## Quick Reference

- **Project Type**: Python-based documentation generation using MkDocs and SFIA data
- **Key Directories**:
  - `docs/` - Documentation markdown files
  - `scripts/` - Python generation scripts
  - `input/` - Source data (SFIA CSV, PDF reference)
  - `.cursor/rules/` - This rules directory

## Rule Files

1. [@01-project-structure.mdc](01-project-structure.mdc) - File organization and project layout
2. [@02-python-standards.mdc](02-python-standards.mdc) - Python code standards and conventions
3. [@03-sfia-data-handling.mdc](03-sfia-data-handling.mdc) - SFIA CSV parsing and data management
4. [@04-page-generation.mdc](04-page-generation.mdc) - Role page generation workflow
5. [@05-markdown-standards.mdc](05-markdown-standards.mdc) - Documentation formatting standards
6. [@06-development-workflow.mdc](06-development-workflow.mdc) - Development server and testing
7. [@07-git-practices.mdc](07-git-practices.mdc) - Version control guidelines
8. [@08-mkdocs-configuration.mdc](08-mkdocs-configuration.mdc) - MkDocs setup and navigation
9. [@09-role-definitions.mdc](09-role-definitions.mdc) - Role and skill code definitions
10. [@10-error-prevention.mdc](10-error-prevention.mdc) - Common mistakes and how to avoid them

## How These Rules Work

- **alwaysApply: true** - Rules that are always included in every chat session (critical rules)
- **globs: ["pattern"]** - Rules that apply when working with specific file patterns
- **description only** - Rules that are intelligently applied when the Agent determines they're relevant

## Critical Warnings

⚠️ **DO NOT manually edit files in `docs/roles/`** - These are auto-generated by `scripts/generate_pages.py`

⚠️ **Always use the virtual environment** - Never install packages globally. Use `venv/bin/python3` or activate venv first.

⚠️ **Regenerate pages after script changes** - After modifying `scripts/generate_pages.py`, always regenerate all role pages.

## Getting Started

1. Review [@01-project-structure.mdc](01-project-structure.mdc) to understand the project layout
2. Check [@10-error-prevention.mdc](10-error-prevention.mdc) for common mistakes to avoid
3. Refer to specific rule files when working in those areas
