# Associate QA Engineer

**Level 1** | **Career Path:** Engineering

**Engineer Type:** QA

---

## Role Overview

**Scope Summary:** A new engineer at the start of their career, focussed on expanding their knowledge and skill set to further increase their impact within a team.

Associate Engineers are at the first stage of their software engineering career. They're contributing to the team's goals through executing on well-defined tasks, with support from more experienced engineers. As someone early in their career, they're focussed on increasing their Software Engineering skill set and knowledge at a high pace. So that they can start to deliver tasks with less support and progress towards "Engineer".

## Required SFIA Skills

The following SFIA skills define the expected skills and behaviors for this role at this level:

### Functional testing (TEST)

**SFIA Reference:** [TEST](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/TEST)

**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Assessing specified or unspecified functional requirements and characteristics of products, systems and services through investigation and testing.

**Guidance Notes:**

Functional testing verifies that systems, components and interfaces deliver specific functionality, operate as intended and meet user expectations. Risk-based test planning and execution is a key aspect, focusing on identifying and mitigating risks such as functionality errors, integration failures, edge case defects, data inconsistencies and non-compliance with requirements.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

collaborating with stakeholders to align testing with business requirements and objectives
designing and adapting test cases based on requirements, including various scenarios, boundary values and edge cases
preparing data and configuring environments to simulate realistic use cases
executing tests to verify actual results align with expected outcomes
logging defects with detailed reproduction steps, prioritising issues and providing feedback for improvements
analysing results to identify patterns, assess quality and suggest system/testing enhancements
promoting a shift-left approach by integrating functional testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection
managing, executing and automating tests, including regression and smoke tests, to improve efficiency and coverage
developing and maintaining scalable, reliable automated tests and frameworks to validate critical functionality and ensure continuous quality
ensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.

**Level 1 Attainment:**

Executes given manual functional test scripts under supervision to verify basic software capabilities.
Configures test environments, uses basic automated tools for functionality verification, records results and reports issues.

### Non-functional testing (NFTS)

**SFIA Reference:** [NFTS](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/NFTS)

**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Assessing systems and services to evaluate performance, security, scalability and other non-functional qualities against requirements or expected standards.

**Guidance Notes:**

Non-functional testing assesses the behaviour of technology, system components, configurations and packages, ensuring they work together to support the system's operation. It focuses on identifying and mitigating risks related to system qualities and characteristics, such as performance, security, backup and recovery, availability, scalability, reliability, maintainability, monitoring, resource efficiency and compliance with technical standards.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

collaborating with stakeholders to clarify non-functional requirements and expectations
setting up test environments that mirror production conditions, simulating real-world usage
preparing and managing test data to accurately represent necessary variety and volumes
designing and executing stress, load, security and other non-functional tests
troubleshooting issues during testing, coordinating with technical teams to resolve problems
participating in reviews to refine non-functional requirements, identifying risks and suggesting enhancements
analysing results to assess system performance, security and other key qualities, providing insights for improvement
promoting a shift-left approach by integrating non-functional testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection
adapting testing strategies to suit various development methodologies
developing and maintaining automated tests, monitoring systems and frameworks to continuously assess system quality and performance
ensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.

**Level 1 Attainment:**

Executes given non-functional test scripts under supervision, focusing on system qualities and characteristics such as performance.
Sets up basic test environments and uses standard tools to execute prescribed tests.
Records results and reports issues.
