# Software Engineer

**Level 2** | **Career Path:** Engineering

**Engineer Type:** Software

---

## Role Overview

**Scope Summary:** An engineer with high potential, developing the fundamentals they need to be successful in their team.

Engineers are in the earlier stages of their software engineering career. They're working on well-defined tasks and are supported by the team when stuck. They're expected to ask lots of questions. As someone progresses toward "Senior Engineer" they should start to gain confidence to pick up larger or less well-defined tasks with less required support.

## Required SFIA Skills

The following SFIA skills define the expected skills and behaviors for this role at this level:

### Software design (SWDN)

**SFIA Reference:** [SWDN](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/SWDN)

**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Architecting and designing software to meet specified requirements, ensuring adherence to established standards and principles.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

designing and architecting software applications, components, interfaces and related characteristics (including security)
designing for scalability, performance, resilience, security and privacy from the outset, aligned with cloud computing, distributed systems and data protection
applying design concepts, patterns, modelling techniques and architectural styles such as microservices, serverless and domain-driven design to develop software designs and architectures, which serve as the foundation for software construction and verification
evaluating alternative solutions and trade-offs to facilitate design decisions
considering functional and non-functional requirements such as the target environment, performance, security, scalability and integration with existing systems
adopting and adapting software design models, tools and techniques based on the context of the work, including contemporary practices such as cloud-native architectures, edge computing, cyber-physical systems and agile and iterative design practices
developing prototypes/simulations to enable informed decision-making.

Unlike programming and designing at the code level, this skill focuses on higher-level design, addressing architecture and system-wide considerations.

**Level 2 Attainment:**

Creates and documents detailed designs for simple software applications or components. 
Applies agreed modelling techniques, standards, patterns and tools. 
Contributes to the design of components of larger software systems, ensuring alignment with overall design requirements, including security.
Reviews own work.

### Programming/software development (PROG)

**SFIA Reference:** [PROG](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/PROG)

**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Developing software components to deliver value to stakeholders.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

identifying, creating and applying software development and security standards and processes
planning and designing software components
estimating time and effort required for software development
constructing, amending, and verifying software components, ensuring security is embedded
applying test-driven development and ensuring appropriate test coverage
using peer review techniques such as pair programming
documenting software components
understanding and obtaining agreement to the value of the software components to be developed
selecting appropriate development methods and lifecycles
applying recovery techniques to ensure the software being developed is not lost 
implementing appropriate change control to software development practices
resolving operational problems with software and fixing bugs

Depending on requirements and the characteristics of the project or assigned work, software development methods and lifecycles can be predictive (plan-driven) approaches or adaptive (iterative/agile) approaches.

**Level 2 Attainment:**

Designs, codes, verifies, tests, documents, amends and refactors simple programs/scripts. 
Applies agreed standards, tools and basic security practices to achieve a well-engineered result.
Reviews own work.

### Database administration (DBAD)

**SFIA Reference:** [DBAD](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/DBAD)

**Category:** Delivery and operation | **Subcategory:** Data and records operations

**Overall Description:**

Installing, configuring, monitoring, maintaining databases and data stores, ensuring performance and security and adapting to evolving technologies.

**Guidance Notes:**

Database administration involves managing operational databases in production environments as well as supporting databases for development, testing and iterative improvements. The focus is on ensuring database availability, integrity, security and performance across a variety of database types, including relational, NoSQL and cloud-based databases.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

identifying and acting on automation opportunities to improve performance and value from databases, data stores and data pipelines
using database management system software and tools including both cloud-based and on-premises solutions
applying knowledge of the logical database schema
ensuring compliance with data privacy laws and regulations
designing and implementing disaster recovery, backup strategies, and security monitoring protocols
integrating and managing databases across hybrid environments, combining on-premises and cloud-based solutions
monitoring emerging database technologies and trends, including security features and vulnerabilities.

**Level 2 Attainment:**

Executes operational procedures, runs automation scripts and performs routine maintenance and monitoring of databases.
Adjusts automation tasks as instructed to meet operational standards for databases.
Reports on database performance, addresses issues directly when possible, or escalates to others for resolution.

### Deployment (DEPL)

**SFIA Reference:** [DEPL](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/DEPL)

**Category:** Delivery and operation | **Subcategory:** Technology management

**Overall Description:**

Transitioning software from development to live usage, managing risks and ensuring it works as intended.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

moving new or changed components to testing, staging and live environments
managing deployments using suitable approaches, such as phased rollouts or continuous delivery
maintaining secure locations for components awaiting deployment 
using deployment tools and techniques to ensure consistent and repeatable deployments, supporting governance, audit and change management
monitoring and troubleshooting deployment processes
rolling back deployments in case of issues or failures
ensuring the availability, performance and security of deployed components
collaborating with release management and other teams 
considering supplier-controlled deployments and their impact on the organisation's environment.

**Level 2 Attainment:**

Assists in deploying software releases and updates under routine supervision.
Executes defined deployment processes and procedures using deployment tools and techniques.
Monitors deployed applications and reports issues. Assists in rolling back deployments when necessary.
