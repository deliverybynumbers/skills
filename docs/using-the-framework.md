# How to Use This Framework

This framework is designed to support clear, honest conversations about progression between you and your manager. It's most useful when it's treated as a shared reference point, rather than something to be "applied" or assessed against in isolation.

Here are a few practical ways to use it.

## Before a 1:1 or Progression Conversation

- Use the level descriptions to reflect on how you're currently operating day to day.
- Notice where you feel confident operating at your current level, and where you may already be taking on responsibility associated with the next level.
- Use the skills and examples as prompts to gather concrete evidence of how you work, the decisions you make, and the outcomes you own.

## During Conversations

- Use the framework as a shared language to talk about scope, responsibility and expectations.
- Focus on how you're operating in practice, rather than trying to "score" yourself against individual skills.
- Be open about where you're stretching, where you feel blocked, and what support might help you grow.

## For Development and Growth

- Treat the framework as a guide for direction, not a checklist to complete.
- You're not expected to demonstrate equal depth across every skill. Different roles, strengths and opportunities will shape where you focus.
- Development often looks like gradually taking on more complex problems, broader influence, or greater ownership, rather than learning something entirely new.

## Understanding Progression

Progression isn't automatic, and it doesn't happen just because time has passed. Moving between levels requires a conversation, and in some cases an appropriate role or opportunity to be available. Sometimes you may be ready to operate at the next level before a formal move is possible; other times, a clear gap in scope or responsibility may need to be addressed first.

When making progression decisions, you and your manager should be able to clearly explain:

- How you're operating today compared to the expectations of the next level
- What evidence shows you're ready to take on greater responsibility and scope
- What would help you continue to grow, whether or not a role change is immediately available

Used this way, the framework supports thoughtful progression conversations, rather than forcing premature decisions or rigid assessments.
