# About the Career Framework

## What is SFIA?

The Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA) is a globally recognized framework for describing skills and competencies in the digital world. SFIA provides:

- **Common Language** - A shared vocabulary for describing IT and digital skills
- **Skill Definitions** - Detailed descriptions of skills at different levels of responsibility
- **Career Guidance** - Clear progression paths and skill expectations
- **Industry Standard** - Used by organizations worldwide for skills assessment and development

## Framework Levels

SFIA defines seven levels of responsibility and autonomy:

1. **Level 1** - Follow: Works under routine supervision, follows instructions
2. **Level 2** - Assist: Works under routine supervision, assists others
3. **Level 3** - Apply: Works independently, applies knowledge and skills
4. **Level 4** - Enable: Works independently, enables others
5. **Level 5** - Ensure/Advise: Works independently, ensures outcomes, advises others
6. **Level 6** - Initiate/Influence: Works independently, initiates and influences
7. **Level 7** - Set Strategy/Inspire/Mobilize: Sets strategy, inspires and mobilizes

## How This Framework Works

Each role in this framework is defined by:

1. **Required SFIA Skills** - A set of skills relevant to the role
2. **Level-Specific Descriptions** - What attainment looks like at that level for each skill
3. **Overall Skill Context** - The broader context and purpose of each skill

### Skill Definitions

For each skill, you'll find:

- **Overall Description** - What the skill encompasses
- **Guidance Notes** - Additional context and activities
- **Level-Specific Attainment** - What demonstrating this skill looks like at the role's level

## Career Progression

This framework supports career development by:

- **Clarity** - Clear expectations for each role and level
- **Progression** - Visible paths for career advancement
- **Skills-Based** - Focus on demonstrable skills rather than job titles
- **Flexibility** - Multiple paths to suit different interests and strengths
