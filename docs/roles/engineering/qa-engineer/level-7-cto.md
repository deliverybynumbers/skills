# CTO

**Level 7** | **Career Path:** Engineering

**Engineer Type:** QA

---

## Framework Overview

Our approach is built around a small number of core ideas that shape engineering progression:

- **Impact-focused**: We focus on the impact each engineer has on moving the business forward, rather than on long lists of specific skills and behaviours.
- **Scope increases with seniority**: As you grow, so does the complexity and size of the problems you are expected to solve. As the business grows, the engineering challenges should grow with it.
- **Simple and meaningful**: This framework brings the most important behaviours and expectations together in a simple way. It is not meant to cover everything an engineer might do, but to highlight the meaningful differences between levels.
- **Broad behaviours**: Behaviours are intentionally broad so they reflect the many ways engineers can contribute. Our aim is to describe the level of technical contribution and mindset we expect at each stage, not create a checklist of tasks.
- **Supporting conversations**: We want to make space for the different ways people add value. This framework exists to support 1:1s, performance reviews and development conversations, helping managers and engineers talk clearly about scope, impact and alignment with our engineering principles.
- **Practice-focused**: The framework focuses on the practice of engineering itself, not the specific tools or languages you use.

**Levels are cumulative**: Each level builds on the one before it. Engineers are expected to show the behaviours and technical habits of earlier levels as they progress.

### Impact

Impact is the primary driver for progression. Your impact reflects your sphere of influence and the contribution you make to our mission and goals. Different roles and disciplines create impact in different ways. Focusing on impact allows us to recognise engineers who move things forward (and who "get things done") without requiring them to perform specific routines.

Impact grows through a mix of building technical skill, gaining real experience, learning from that experience and pairing it with the right behaviours.

**Excellence here looks like:**

- Choosing work that meaningfully moves your team, discipline and the business forward, in line with the scope of your role.
- Identifying opportunities to improve engineering outcomes and making them clear so the team can prioritise effectively.
- Consistently getting things done, contributing to the team and earning a reputation as a reliable, high-quality engineer.

### Technical Skills

This section is about how you apply your technical ability and develop your craft. It describes the behaviours that show effective technical contribution at different levels of complexity and ambiguity.

We look at technical contribution through four lenses: quality, testability, performance and your ability to design and review systems.

**Excellence here looks like:**

- Your code and technical work are considered high quality by your peers and senior engineers.
- You can design systems that solve business problems efficiently and reduce ambiguity at both the technical and product level.
- You design with the right level of complexity, keeping things simple where possible.
- Your work is resilient, well tested and capable of scaling as the business grows.

### Behaviours

Behaviours sit alongside technical skills and impact. They cover the core habits, mindsets and ways of working we expect engineers to show.

Through your behaviour you set the tone for those around you. Great engineers role model great behaviours, and self-aware engineers know when they are setting a strong example.

Behaviours reflect consistent habits and intentional choices, rather than doing the right thing by chance or on "autopilot".

## Role Overview

**Scope Summary:** The senior technical leader responsible for setting technical strategy and direction.

The CTO sets technical strategy and direction for the organisation, inspiring and mobilising teams to achieve engineering excellence.

## Required SFIA Skills

The following SFIA skills define the expected skills and behaviors for this role at this level:

### Functional testing (TEST)

**SFIA Reference:** [TEST](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/TEST)

**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Assessing specified or unspecified functional requirements and characteristics of products, systems and services through investigation and testing.

**Guidance Notes:**

Functional testing verifies that systems, components and interfaces deliver specific functionality, operate as intended and meet user expectations. Risk-based test planning and execution is a key aspect, focusing on identifying and mitigating risks such as functionality errors, integration failures, edge case defects, data inconsistencies and non-compliance with requirements.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

collaborating with stakeholders to align testing with business requirements and objectives
designing and adapting test cases based on requirements, including various scenarios, boundary values and edge cases
preparing data and configuring environments to simulate realistic use cases
executing tests to verify actual results align with expected outcomes
logging defects with detailed reproduction steps, prioritising issues and providing feedback for improvements
analysing results to identify patterns, assess quality and suggest system/testing enhancements
promoting a shift-left approach by integrating functional testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection
managing, executing and automating tests, including regression and smoke tests, to improve efficiency and coverage
developing and maintaining scalable, reliable automated tests and frameworks to validate critical functionality and ensure continuous quality
ensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.

**Level 7 Attainment:**

Develops organisational policies, standards and guidelines for functional testing, ensuring they align with business strategy and incorporate a risk-based approach.
Plans and leads complex testing initiatives, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives and incorporating a risk-based approach.
Manages risks and opportunities, coordinates with other testing activities and drives improvements in functional testing capabilities.
Promotes a culture of quality in functional testing, driving adherence to organisational standards and proactive risk mitigation.

### Non-functional testing (NFTS)

**SFIA Reference:** [NFTS](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/NFTS)

**Category:** Development and implementation | **Subcategory:** Systems development

**Overall Description:**

Assessing systems and services to evaluate performance, security, scalability and other non-functional qualities against requirements or expected standards.

**Guidance Notes:**

Non-functional testing assesses the behaviour of technology, system components, configurations and packages, ensuring they work together to support the system's operation. It focuses on identifying and mitigating risks related to system qualities and characteristics, such as performance, security, backup and recovery, availability, scalability, reliability, maintainability, monitoring, resource efficiency and compliance with technical standards.
Activities may include, but are not limited to:

collaborating with stakeholders to clarify non-functional requirements and expectations
setting up test environments that mirror production conditions, simulating real-world usage
preparing and managing test data to accurately represent necessary variety and volumes
designing and executing stress, load, security and other non-functional tests
troubleshooting issues during testing, coordinating with technical teams to resolve problems
participating in reviews to refine non-functional requirements, identifying risks and suggesting enhancements
analysing results to assess system performance, security and other key qualities, providing insights for improvement
promoting a shift-left approach by integrating non-functional testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection
adapting testing strategies to suit various development methodologies
developing and maintaining automated tests, monitoring systems and frameworks to continuously assess system quality and performance
ensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.

**Level 7 Attainment:**
