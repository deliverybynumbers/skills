Activities may include, but are not limited to:

identifying, classifying, processing information that is used to support decision-making, business processes and digital services
developing innovative ways of managing the information assets of the organisation
governance of how information is used to support decision-making, business processes and digital services
ensuring information can be discovered and delivered in line with organisational policies and practices
developing and promoting strategies and policies for the design of information architectures, structures and taxonomies
implementing systems of cataloguing, metadata, indexing and classification standards and methods used to organise information

**Level 3 Attainment:**

Supports teams and individuals to identify and organise information assets and repositories in line with policy and practices.

### Information security (SCTY)

**SFIA Reference:** [SCTY](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/SCTY)

**Category:** Strategy and architecture | **Subcategory:** Security and privacy

**Overall Description:**

Defining and operating a framework of security controls and security management strategies.

**Guidance Notes:**

Activities may include, but are not limited to:

selecting and adapting security frameworks to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems
implementing security controls, including physical, procedural, technical, and compliance measures
ensuring accountability and adherence to relevant laws and standards
embedding secure by design principles throughout the system's lifecycle, ensuring security is integrated from the earliest design stages, through development, deployment, and into operations
identifying and mitigating risks in infrastructure and applications.

Security controls include, but are not limited to:

physical controls - protecting tangible assets and physical environments
procedural or administrative controls - policies and guidelines governing organisational security practices
technical or logical controls - hardware and software measures that protect information systems
legal, regulatory or compliance controls - measures ensuring laws, regulations and industry standards.

These activities are typically performed in collaboration with specialists in other areas including, but not limited to: legal, technical infrastructure, audit, architecture and software engineering.

**Level 3 Attainment:**

Applies and maintains specific security controls as required by organisational policy and local risk assessments.
Communicates security risks and issues to business managers and others. Performs basic risk assessments for small information systems. 
Contributes to the identification of risks that arise from potential technical solution architectures. Suggests alternate solutions or countermeasures to mitigate risks. Defines secure systems configurations in compliance with intended architectures.

### Penetration testing (PENT)

**SFIA Reference:** [PENT](https://sfia-online.org/en/skillcode/9/PENT)

**Category:** Delivery and operation | **Subcategory:** Security services

**Overall Description:**

Testing the effectiveness of security controls by emulating the tools and techniques of likely attackers.

**Guidance Notes:**

Penetration testing may be a stand-alone activity or an aspect of acceptance testing prior to an approval to operate.
Activities include, but are not limited to:

ethical hacking (using the same tools and techniques as an adversary to safely exploit security weaknesses)
demonstrating how an adversary can subvert security goals or achieve specific adversarial objectives
evaluating the effectiveness of current/planned defences or mitigation controls
assuring the security of networks, systems and applications
assessing the strength and effectiveness of cryptographic implementations
identifying insights into the business risks of various vulnerabilities
testing network, infrastructure, web and mobile applications for weaknesses
checking patch levels and configurations
social engineering.

**Level 3 Attainment:**

Follows standard approaches to design and execute penetration testing activities.
Researches and investigates attack techniques and recommends ways to defend against them. 
Analyses and reports on penetration testing activities, results, issues and risks.
